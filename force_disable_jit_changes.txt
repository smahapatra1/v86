v86/src/rust/config.rs has a constant:

pub const FORCE_DISABLE_JIT: bool = false

We'd like to replace it with a runtime flag:
 ?jit_disable=1

So first we check where this constant is used and start our changes
from the cycle_internal function defined in src/rust/cpu/cpu.rs.
Then we keep building the call graph by searching for cycle_internal and its caller and so on.
We pass force_disable_jit flag to all those functions.
Ultimately that leads us to CPU.prototype.main_run defined in src/cpu.js and its caller
in src/main.js.
Here we have hardcoded the force_disable_jit argument to false. It is the only remaining thing
that should be changed to read form a runtime flag instead.
